There was once a young lad named Chad.  Chad had a very tall dad.  Chad rode a horse once.  He did not have a swell time.

Chad spent his birthday money on a game. The game's name was Borderland 2. He enjoyed the game. He was happy alone.

Chad's dad was mad because he didn't like the horse. As punishment his dad took his game away.

A week after he bought Borderland 2 with his precious birthday money, the game was made free to play. Chad hated the game

Chad took his anger out on horses in Red Dead Redemption 2.  Is this a healthy outlet?  Since no real horses are harmed is the behavior still in bad taste?
